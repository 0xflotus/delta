## Description

Stanford Natural Language Inference corpus is a new, freely available collection of labeled sentence pairs, written by humans doing a novel grounded task based on image captioning. At 570K pairs, it is two orders of magnitude larger than all other resources of its type. This in- crease in scale allows lexicalized classi- fiers to outperform some sophisticated ex- isting entailment models, and it allows a neural network-based model to perform competitively on natural language infer- ence benchmarks for the first time.

## Data scale introduction

- Training pairs：550,152
