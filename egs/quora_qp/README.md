## Description

Quora is a place to gain and share knowledge—about anything. It’s a platform to ask questions and connect with people who contribute unique insights and quality answers. 
This empowers people to learn from each other and to better understand the world.Kagglers are challenged to tackle this natural 
language processing problem by applying advanced techniques to classify whether question pairs are duplicates or not. Doing so will make it easier to find high quality 
answers to questions resulting in an improved experience for Quora writers, seekers, and readers.
